## Contribution

You need to have [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html) installed. You can run `brew install pandoc` on Mac OS.

Make a fork of the repo or go on a branch.

Add files to the `notes` folder, link them in `notes/index.md` in the same way other files are linked, and then run `make` and submit a pull request.
